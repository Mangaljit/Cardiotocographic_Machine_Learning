In this project, we used the Cardiotocography (CTG) data set available on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository website at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml /datasets/cardiotocography.

2126 fetal cardiotocographs (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features were measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label, labelled as NSP (Normal (1), Suspect (2), or Pathologic (3)).

There are 21 features and 1 response labelled as NSP.

The aim is to use the given features to write different machine learning algorithms and compare their accuracies to predict the NSP state of 1, 2 or 3.
